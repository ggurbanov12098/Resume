# Short Overview
As you are aware, I am nearing the completion of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at ADA University, with an anticipated graduation date of May 2024. Throughout my academic tenure, I have dedicated myself to excellence in various realms of computer science, notably in Data Science, Cybersecurity, and Network Operations.

* Academic and Professional Background:

    * Data Analytics application for Senior Design Project: Data Analytics Application: 
    
    A critical component of the project was the use of Data Analytics to analyze network traffic and identify potential threats efficiently. This was achieved through:

    Integration of Data Analytics in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): The project developed a customized IDS that could analyze network data and detect anomalies. This system was tailored to recognize patterns indicative of specific types of cyberattacks, enhancing the precision of threat detection.
    Use of Splunk for Event Monitoring and Analysis: Splunk was utilized as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool to aggregate and analyze data from various network devices. This helped in real-time monitoring, which is crucial for timely detection and mitigation of cybersecurity threats.
    Wazuh for Integrity Monitoring and Security Configuration Assessment: Wazuh, an open-source security platform, was employed to perform file integrity monitoring and security configuration assessments, providing continuous surveillance and vulnerability identification within the network.


    * Internship at ABB: As a Network Operations Center Analyst Intern, I utilized advanced monitoring tools such as Wazuh, Zabbix, and Dynatrace, and supported Active Directory services. This role allowed me to develop crucial skills in maintaining and securing vital network resources, which are pivotal in a high-stakes financial environment.

    * Data Analyst at BestComp Group: My role involved significant research and data analysis, where I prepared extensive reports on industry trends, further honing my data management and analytical skills. Also have actively participated in projects such as developing an OCR model for license number recognition and training a YOLOv5 object detection model aimed at detecting license plates. These experiences have sharpened my analytical skills and proficiency in handling large datasets and complex models.

* Educational Achievements:

    * I have consistently demonstrated academic excellence at ADA University, which is evidenced by my qualification for the Dean's List of High Performance. My academic journey has been complemented by successful completions of professional courses in Cybersecurity and Network Security from Google on Coursera, and advanced bootcamps in Embedded Systems and Python Development.

* Skills and Attributes:

    * Technical Proficiency: My technical toolkit includes programming in Python, Java, JavaScript, C, and Bash, alongside advanced knowledge in Computer Networks, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence.

    * Soft Skills: I bring a proactive approach to both individual and collaborative projects, highlighted by my ability to adapt and communicate effectively in diverse settings.

* Volunteer Work and Leadership:

    * My commitment extends beyond academics and professional engagements to community service, where I have contributed as a volunteer at the Hackathons, ADA Innovation Center, Baku City Circuit (Formula 1), and other organizations focusing on technological empowerment and education.
